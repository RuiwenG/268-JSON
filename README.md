# JSON and Serialization

This repo aims to help people understand how does serialization work in Flutter, and how to parse JSON files in the background.

## Getting Started

### Setting up json_serializable in a project

To include json_serializable in your project, you need one regular dependency, and two dev dependencies. In short, dev dependencies are dependencies that are not included in our app source codeâ€”they are only used in the development environment.

To add the dependencies, run flutter pub add:

<code> flutter pub add json_annotation dev:build_runner dev:json_serializable </code>

Run flutter pub get inside your project root folder (or click Packages get in your editor) to make these new dependencies available in your project.

### Parsing JSON in the background

<code> flutter pub add http </code></p>
For this repository, we are using the free API call from <https://openweathermap.org>. To utilize this function, create <code>.env</code> file with your API key under the root folder. </p>
The format is <code>API_KEY=...</code>
